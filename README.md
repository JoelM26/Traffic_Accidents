# Traffic_Accidents

What type of weather conditions create the most traffic accidents and what time do most accidents occur?

This project aims to answer that question with a primary regional focus being Indiana, but also takes a glance at the whole country.

## Motivation

This project covers a curiosity about when, where, and at what time most traffic accidents seem to occur.  Initially, we wanted to know whether the worst weather conditions really caused the most accidents.  That curiosity grew into wondering when the most accidents happened and then included where they happened.
